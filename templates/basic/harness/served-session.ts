/**
 * Served (B-host) placement — the harness-RUNNING half the driver INJECTS.
 * Isolated from the factories in `./served-runtime` because it imports the
 * `harness`: the web target's `serve.ts` hands it to the driver as `run`, and the
 * host calls it once per admitted Session as a structured child.
 *
 * Structurally identical to the reference `research` template + reasoning.run: a
 * Session provisions the enabled abilities' Services into ITS OWN scope (a no-op for
 * the default wikipedia ability, which needs none), builds the served `Runner`,
 * publishes it on `RunnerCtx`, and runs the UNCHANGED `harness(...)`. The provision
 * is per-session (not host-boot) so no tenant's context is shared — the same
 * isolation reasoning.run's per-session reranker gives. `cfg.model.reranker` is a
 * resolved `{path}` when a reranker-using ability is enabled; absent, `provisionAbilityModels`
 * falls back to the platform catalog default (and is a no-op if no ability needs one).
