/**
 * Fail fast, naming the command that fixes it, when an AgentApp this harness
 * imports was never vendored.
 *
 * `harness/harness.ts` imports its apps at the top level, so a scaffold made
 * with `--skip-apps` — or one whose fetch failed — cannot typecheck. Without
 * this guard `npm start` dies inside `tsc` with a bare TS2307: the compiler
 * complaining about a supply problem. Running ahead of the compiler puts the
 * `lloyal install` line in front of the user instead.
 *
 * Both truth sources are in package.json, and the CLI writes both:
 *
 *   harnessdev.apps        the install specs `lloyal new` recorded
 *   dependencies[<name>]   `file:vendor/<publisher>__<name>-<version>.tgz`,
 *                          written by verifyAndVendorApp → setFileDependency
 *                          (harness-cli/src/scaffold/vendor-app.ts)
 *
 * A spec is satisfied when some dependency points at its vendored tarball. That
 * `vendor/<flat>-<version>.tgz` shape is the ONE thing this script assumes about
 * the CLI — keep it in sync with vendor-app.ts if it ever changes.
 *
 * Deliberately narrow: this checks only that the apps were VENDORED. "Vendored
 * but never npm-installed" is left to `bin/run.js`, which sees the real
 * resolution failure and so cannot guess wrong about it.
